Hello! I'm an electrical engineer and open hardware hacker living near Portland, Oregon. Lately I've been trying out all sorts of interesting hobbies. 
<br /><br />
I've also been thinking a lot about the importance of wildness as a necessary part of my mental health in light of my modern, electronics-dependent, urbanized way of life.
<br /><br />
Professionally, I designed the hardware and software for aircraft cameras with Astronics Max-Viz, and now I help provide affordable, small quantity, purple printed circuit boards at <a href="http://oshpark.com">OSHPark</a>. You can find my open source code and schematics on <a href="http://github.com/wicker">Github</a>.
<br /><br />
This is my personal website, but I also develop hardware prototypes for entrepreneurs through <a href="http://wickerbox.net/">Wickerbox Electronics</a>. I'm available to design circuits, select components, lay out boards, write low-level microcontroller code, develop documentation, give a talk, and/or offer project advice. Feel free to <a href="mailto:jeh.wicker@gmail.com">email me</a>.
