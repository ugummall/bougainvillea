David A Mellis designed a <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/%7Emellis/gsm/">cellphone module</a> using the <a href="http://www.quectel.com/product/prodetail.aspx?id=14">Quectel GSM/GPRS M10 2G module</a> and the Arduino GSM Shield library. The 2G networks in Portland are on their way out so I updated David's design with his permission and replaced the M10 with a <a href="http://www.quectel.com/product/prodetail.aspx?id=64">Quectel UMTS/HSDPA UC15 3G module</a>. 

The modules have different pinouts, slightly different packages, and the UC15 takes 3.3V-4.3V while the M10 took 3.3V-4.6V, which is still fine for a 3.7V standard LiPo battery.  

I got the boards back and did an initial build last week; I'm working with a software dev so we're going to try to spin it up this week and see where we get.

The currently <em>untested</em> hardware is available <em>for reference</em> at the <a href="http://github.com/wicker/cellphone3g">GitHub repo</a> and released as open hardware under the MIT license. I will update this when it works.

"General packet radio service (GPRS) is a packet oriented mobile data service on the 2G and 3G cellular communication system's global system for mobile communications (GSM)." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service">Wikipedia</a>

"UMTS specifies a complete network system, which includes the radio access network (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network, or UTRAN), the core network (Mobile Application Part, or MAP) and the authentication of users via SIM (subscriber identity module) cards." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Mobile_Telecommunications_System">Wikipedia</a>

"High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) is an enhanced 3G (third-generation) mobile-telephony communications protocol in the High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) family, also dubbed 3.5G, 3G+, or Turbo 3G, which allows networks based on Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) to have higher data-transfer speeds and capacity." <a href="https://github.com/wicker/cellphone3g/blob/master/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Speed_Downlink_Packet_Access">Wikipedia</a>
