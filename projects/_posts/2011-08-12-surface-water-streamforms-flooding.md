This project used ArcGIS to identify stream landforms on the Snoqualmie River for my physical geology lab at Portland State.

#####Stream and River Geomorphology

The prominent natural features are the Snoqualmie River and its valley, with hills to either side. There's an interconnected hooked lake system with oxbows and a couple of solitary lakes. The contour interval of the map is 10 feet. Maximum elevation is 669 feet and minimum elevation is 20 feet. The prominent anthropogenic feature is the town of Carnation and the highway. There's a sewage disposal plant and a couple of farms, as well as a fill. 

The figure below includes specific hydrologic features. Stream morphology is defined as the way the stream changes over time. The stream gradient affects this because gradient correlates to gravity. Streams with steeper slopes will have a higher speed, thus allowing a higher sediment load as well as having a faster rate of erosion, cutting ever-deeper channels into the bedrock. These streams are less likely to meander and more likely to turn into braided streams. 

Braided streams are what occur when a meandering river has a high gradient capable of carrying a high sediment load. The pattern in which the sediment load is dropped forces the water to find many different paths, and it has the energy to do so. The gradient for Snoqualmie is fairly small. The river does not appear to have the capacity or competence for a high sediment load, so the water has no energy to depart from its main channel. Its changes in direction are very gradual, leading to those oxbow lakes.

#####Flood Hazards

The only disadvantage of a floodplain is the flooding. Otherwise, they are excellent for building on because they're very flat, the soil is very good for farming because it's rich in nutrients and there's access to freshwater. Because floodplains can extend quite some distance from a river and the probability of a large enough flood to damage housing built on that area is only 1% a year, developers see prospects of getting rich and forget about all the disadvantages.

Looking at the original .tif file independent of ArcGIS reveals enough to determine the presence of a flood plain. In the central area north of the town, there are contour intervals indicating height in the curve of the oxbow lakes. Also, between the river and the contour rises on either bank, the map indicates the presence of marshes. The ground is constantly wet, which means any rainfall or rise in the river produces water onto already-saturated soil, leading to a flood.

In the larger perspective, the river valley is about a mile across throughout the map. Right at the river's edge there's a 40' contour interval. Set back approximately a tenth of a mile from the river is a terrace at 50'. The other smaller streams and the collection of oxbow lakes follow channels at 40' within 50' stream banks.

The next contour interval is right at the valley walls, jumping in some places up to 400' in a tenth of a mile. This is the natural boundary for the 100-year flood. Except for natural contour rises at the river itself and the oxbow lakes, the valley has no contour rise for that half-mile in either direction. The flatness of the valley is the clearest indicator for the existence and boundaries of the floodplain. Superimposing FEMA's map over the river valley yields exactly the conclusions expected by the indicators above. Each floodplain corresponds to contour rises and geological features across the valley.
