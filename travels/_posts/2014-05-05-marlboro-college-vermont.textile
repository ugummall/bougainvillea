A friend of mine went off to a tiny liberal arts college on a hilltop in Vermont to get a philosophy and literature degree, which might be the exact opposite of what I've done in every way, so I went out to visit him shortly before graduation. I arrived in Boston just after midnight, rented a car, and drove through New Hampshire to Vermont. 

These are just some photos for my own memories. The woods in particular were beautiful. Marlboro, like the rest of the East Coast, experienced a super cold winter that lingered into May, though I guess the snow had melted right before I got there. Walking and talking on the trails was satisfying, and everywhere there were glimpses of other people having been there: sculptures, little shrines, art.

Dalrymple and the back of the library. I didn't take many photos since I was too busy hanging out, but I wanted to have something visual to remember.

Googly eyes stuck on National Geographic cut-outs around the house.
