I hadn't been up here in years and need a gentle break-me-in hike during spring break. Taking the switchbacks up above Multnomah Falls, taking the trail west toward Wahkeena Falls, and coming back down in a loop along Hwy 30. It's about five miles and gorgeous, lots of birds. Not a lot of people once you're past the falls. There was still some snow so it was muddy but the signs to Angel's and Devil's Rests were tempting...
